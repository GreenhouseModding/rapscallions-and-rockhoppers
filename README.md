# Penguins
Penguins are a new passive mob with two types. The Rockhopper Penguin can be found in Stony Shores, whereas the Chinstrap Penguin can be found within Frozen Ocean and Deep Frozen Oceans.

Penguins have a variety of behaviors associated with them, but the main draw is that they can travel with your boat to speed it up, just make sure to have them eat fish from time to time during their travels, or else they'll stop following and return to the shore they're originally from. Depending on the amount of fish they're fed, they may cough up various rewards when you reach a shore. There's even an exciting new item to obtain, Fish Bones.

Fish Bones are a new material item that can be crafted into Bone Meal or a Boat Hook. The Boat Hook is a new item that allows you to link boats together or have boats be leashed to a player.
